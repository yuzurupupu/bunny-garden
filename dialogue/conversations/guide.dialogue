Armand: [[Hi|Hello|Howdy]], little one. It's good to finally meet you!  
Armand: So you're the grandbunny who inherited this farm from Grandpa Flopsy, huh? He always said you'd return one day.  
Armand: Welcome home. 🏡

Armand: The farm's been quiet for a while, but the cows and chickens stayed. They're getting hungry though — they'll need fresh crops to eat!

Armand: Grandpa left you a few tilled plots near the barn — those soft, dark ones. You can also use your hoe on grassy ground to make more farmland.

Armand: I’ve got some seeds for you to start with. Just plant them in the soil, and don’t forget to water them every day — crops won't grow if they stay dry!  
Armand: When they bloom and bear fruit, you’ll be able to harvest them and use them to feed your animals.

Armand: You can also chop trees and break rocks for wood and stone
Armand: Those materials, along with harvested crops, can be sold for coins in the trading stall at the top-right corner of the farm.

Armand: Oh, and don’t be surprised if a mysterious merchant visits the stall each evening — they’re always looking for something special...

Armand: If you’re tired, just go inside your house and rest for the night. A new day brings fresh chances!

Armand: So — ready to hop into action?

- Take crop seeds  
	Eve: Yeah! Grandpa would be proud. I’ll grow the best carrots in the valley!  
	do GameDialogueManager.action_give_crop_seeds()  
	Armand: That’s the spirit! Start near the barn. And remember: water every day and rest when you need to.

- No, I’m not ready yet  
	Eve: Maybe later... It’s a lot to take in right now.  
	Armand: That’s okay, little bun. Farming is a marathon, not a sprint. Just let me know when you’re ready.
