Armand: [[Hi|Hello|Howdy]], little one. It's good to finally meet you!
Armand: So you're the grandbunny who inherited this farm from Grandpa Flopsy, huh? He spoke fondly of you.
Armand: Welcome home. 🏡

Armand: The farm has been quiet for a while, but the cows and chickens are still here... and they're getting hungry!
Armand: You'll need to grow some crops to feed them and get things back in shape.

Armand: Grandpa left you a few tilled plots near the barn — those soft, dark ones over there.
Armand: But don’t worry, you can also create new farmland anywhere by using your hoe on grassy ground.

Armand: I’ve got some seeds to help you start your first crop. Ready to hop into action?

- Take crop seeds  
	Eve: Yeah! Grandpa would be proud. I’ll grow the best carrots in the valley!  
	do GameDialogueManager.action_give_crop_seeds()  
	Armand: That’s the spirit! Start with the plots near the barn. I’ll check in later to see your progress.

- No, I’m not ready yet  
	Eve: Maybe later... It’s a lot to take in right now.  
	Armand: That’s okay, little bun. Farming is a marathon, not a sprint. Let me know when you’re ready.
