Armand: [[Hey there|Hello|Hi]], Eve! Ready to do some harvesting?
Eve: Sure, what should I do?

Armand: First, click on the axe icon in your toolbar to equip it.
Armand: Then walk close to a tree or a rock and press Enter.
Armand: If you’ve got the axe equipped, you’ll chop it down.
Eve: And what happens after I chop them?

Armand: You’ll be able to collect logs from trees, and stones from rocks.
Armand: Pretty useful for crafting later on.

- Got it! I’ll try chopping a tree.
	Eve: On it. Time to collect some wood.
	Armand: Good luck! Big trees drop more logs.
- I’ll try breaking some rocks instead.
	Eve: Rocks won’t stand a chance.
	Armand: That’s the spirit. Look for stones near cliffs or hills.

- I’m done for now => END

Armand: Let me know if you need more guidance.
